= Notes on installing foma =

== From source ==

Get the source tarball, unpack it, or get the svn version with

{{{
svn co http://foma.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/foma/
}}}

  and run

{{{
make; sudo make install
}}}

This should work on most Unix boxes, including Mac OSX. 

To build, _foma_ requires the _readline_ and _zlib_ libraries, which should be present on most systems.  It also uses flex (>=2.5.35) and bison for its parser. However, the tarball distribution comes with the parser files pregenerated.  For building from the svn, flex and bison are needed on the system.

== Mac OSX (binary) ==

Unpack the binary. Move `foma` and `flookup` to a suitable binary directory in your path. E.g. open a terminal in a directory with the files and do:

{{{
sudo cp ./foma /usr/bin/
sudo cp ./flookup /usr/bin/
}}}

The build is compiled for OSX versions >= 10.4.

== Windows ==

The windows binary versions are compiled using cygwin (but do not require cygwin to run). However, this means, the `system` command within foma doesn't work outside cygwin.
